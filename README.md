# galois-theory-reprise
Lecture notes for MATH70037 Galois Theory at Imperial College London, 2024/25.

I did [introductory Galois theory](https://github.com/jieweix/galois-theory-notes) as an undergraduate as well, hence "reprise" in the name of repository. Compared with that first encounter, this one is more rigorous and technical, that is, it avoided much less proofs and played around more with fields and homomorphisms between them, rather than polynomials and their solutions. For example, in this reprise, a *normal* extension K/k is defined to be one such that for any field extension M/k, any two k-linear field homomorphisms K -> M differ by a k-linear automorphism of K, whereas before we knew normal extensions as one such that if an irreducible f in k[x] has one root in K, then all its roots are in K. Due to this technicality and the limit that this module has to be taught within a term, we didn't get to see the usual punchline of a first course on Galois theory, which is the unsolvability of the quintic. Of course, the benefit was that we get a deeper insight into what's going on inside this wonderful machinery that Galois somehow saw in operation before the group concept was even known among mathematicians.
